This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to recognize specific sign language gestures, namely the letters A, B, C, Del, Nothing, and Space.
Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm, the model is trained on 64x64 grayscale images from a custom dataset. 
The goal is to provide a reliable solution that operates from 6 PM to 10 PM, 
enabling efficient real-time video detection and image upload through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed with Tkinter.

Supported Python Version : Python 3.7.16
